            <div>
              <h3 class="body-sub-header">What is your long term goal and/or career pathway?</h3>
              <p>I would like to get involved in tech industry. After completing this course, I plan to work on personal projects where I can apply the skills I've learnt at Dev-Academy, continue improving, and grow into a better programmer.</p>
            </div>

            <div>
              <h3 class="body-sub-header">What do you think your biggest strengths and limitations will be in Bootcamp?</h3>
              <p>I believe my biggest limitation will be my growth mindset. I tend to judge myself very strictly, which can affect my self-confidence and slow down my learning. However, I believe that by working on developing a stronger growth mindset, I can turn this into a future strength by acknowledging my weakness and using them as opportunities to improve.</p>
            </div>

            <div>
              <h3 class="body-sub-header">What do you think your biggest non-technical challenge at Bootcamp will be?</h3>
              <p>My biggest non-technical challenge will be expressing my opinions or feedback openly. I sometimes hold back from being completely honset because I worry about how others might feel. During Bootcamp, I would like to practice sharing my thoughts and emotions more clearly and respectfully.</p>
            </div>

            <div>
              <h3 class="body-sub-header">What non-technical skills - human skills - would you like to see developed in yourself while at Dev Academy?</h3>
              <p>I would like to improve my collaboration and communication skills so I can work more productively and efficiently with others. I also aim to strengthen my growth mindset to support both myself and my team members in staying resilient and motivated through challenges.</p>
            </div>

            <div>
              <h3 class="body-sub-header">What are your expectations from the Bootcamp team?</h3>
              <p>I hope to receive helpful feedback on the projects that I and my future teams complete, from both our peers and facilitators. Constructive feedback will help me continue improving both technically and personally.</p>
            </div>

            <div>
              <h3 class="body-sub-header">What are your expectations of yourself on Bootcamp</h3>
              <p>I expect myself to develop both my technical and human skills so that I can confidently move forward with my personal projects after Dev-Academy. I will fully participate in classes, ask for help when needed, and also offer support to others whenever I can.</p>
