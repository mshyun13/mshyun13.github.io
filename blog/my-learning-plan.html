          <p>
            My long term goal is to start and bulid a successful career in the development industry which aligns with what I majored at university. I enjoy to push myself into situations with various challenges which will help me continuously improve my skills and grow as a developer. Through this course, I aim to build a solid foundation in technical knowledge and have experiences collaborating with different people.
          </p>
          <p>
            One of my biggest strengths is interacting with different people. I don't hesitate to ask for help when needed, and I also enjoy supporting others. By helping others, I go over the concepts I have learnt and solidate my understanding. Another strength is critical thinking. I continuously question myself to ensure there is no missing aspect of a concept I haven't touched and that I'm on the right track. However, this may delays my learning progress and take longer than expected to move to the next topic. So this can sometimes be my limitation.
          </p>
          <p>
            I know that I won't be able to memorise every elements of each lanugages. Instead, I want develop my skill to find the right information efficiently when needed. I also want to develop my skill in integrating online resources into my own code. I want to ensure that I fully understand and make them fit my code rather than copy and paste from online. I believe this requires a lot of practice, and I wish I want to get used to these skills throughout my learning journey at Dev-Academy.
          </p>
          <p>
            To effectively manage my workload in this programme, I will create a weekly plan. The weekly plan will help me estimate the time required for each weekly project and allow me to allocate extra time for going over concepts I find challenging. To work productively and collaborate effectively with others including learners, facilitators, and industry representatives, I will schedule time for learning so that I can fully focus and break to refresh. Also, I will seek help when needed, reaching out to others whenever I got stucked or need different perspective.
          </p>
          <p>
            I understand seeking for help is crucial for my learning. Firstly, I would attempt to solve the problem independently by revisit the materials I covered, and trying to debugging the code. I would also search for the possible solution online. Then I would reach out to the people who are learning this course before reaching out to the facilitators as they may faced the same issues I have.
          </p>
          <p>
            I hope the facilitation team will provide guidance and feedback to help me stay on track throughout the programme. Their feedback on my submission can ba a guideline which leading me to refine my understanding and focus on the possible improvement.
          </p>
          <p>
            Currently, I don't have any block-out times. However, I will reschedule my plan accordingly if there is any changes to ensure they don't affect my learning.
