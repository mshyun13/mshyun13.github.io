            <div>
              <h3 class="body-sub-header">what was the problem?</h3>
              <p>
                I experienced several simple problems due to human errors, such as spelling mistakes, missing '/' in closing HTML tags, and forgetting ',' at the end of object properties in JavaScript. These small human errors ended up breaking the functionality of my code.
              </p>

            <div>
              <h3 class="body-sub-header">what problem-solving techniques did you use?</h3>
              <p>
                I usually start problem-solving by console.loging to check for any errors in the code. If it gave error messages, I would fix them directly. However, in some cases, there were no error messages, but the code still wasn't functioning as expected. Whenever that happened, I used Rubber ducky method. I read through the code line by line and explained each lines of code to myself, and try to understand the purpose of the code, and visualise what the expected output should be.

              <p>
                It felt quite frustrated, as I believed my logic was correct but the result was still wrong. It was hard to tell the exact issue, and it felt like I was stuck for longer than I should have been. However, after taking some time to review and debug the code carefully, I noticed that it was just a small human error causing the whole problem.

              <p>
                These experiences reminded me how even small human errors like missing a character or incorrect formatting can caused unexpected results in coding. I kept remind myself about the importance of paying attention to small details. I also realised the importance of code readability. Writing clean and well-structured code makes it much easier to review and spot these minor errors.

              <h3 class="body-sub-header">what was the problem?</h3>
              <p>
                During a JavaScript Kata session, I was working on questions by using arrays and objects. Initially, I relied on common structures like for loops and if-else statements, but I noticed the code quickly became complicated and hard to manage it. It was difficult to get the correct output, especially when working with arrays and objects. So, I decided to use various array and object methods to simplify the process and to get the correct answers which I couldn't get using only for loops and if-else statement.
              </p>
            </div>

            <div>
              <h3 class="body-sub-header">what problem-solving techniques did you use?</h3>
              <p>
                I started by researching different array and object methods that coud be useful for solving the problems. I spent some time to understand how each method works and how to write them properly. Then I continuously used consol.log() to test and confirm whether the method executing the expected outcomes and whether I was using them correctly.
              </p>
            </div>

            <div>
              <h3 class="body-sub-header">how did you feel throughout the process?</h3>
              <p>
                When I relied only on for loops and if-else statements, my code became too long and unclear. It was easy to get lost, especially when I had to use multiple for loops and if=else statements in a single function. And sometimes, I felt I'm using for loops and if-else statements more than necessary. I believed overusing those statements can possibly reduce code performance. However, once I started using array and object methods, my code became much cleaner, shorter, easier to understand and get correct results that I wasn't able to get using only for loops and if-else statement. I felt more confiedent and productive, and it was satisfying to see simplified code which used to be complexed.

            <div>
              <h3 class="body-sub-header">what did you learn?</h3>
              <p>
                I learnt that using built-in methods can significantly imporve the efficiency and readability of code. They help reduce unnecessary complexity and make the logic easier to follow. I also realised the importance of practicing these methods so I can use them more productively.

              <h3 class="body-sub-header">Pseudocode</h3>
              <p>
                I always try to begin by writing pseudocode before jumping into the actual code. This helps me visualise the logic in advance and guide me throughout the coding process. It gives me a clear direction and reduces the chances of getting lost.

              <h3 class="body-sub-header">Trying something</h3>
              <p>
                Whenever I get error messages, or unexpected outcomes, I try to approach the problem from different perspective. This may leads me to new solutions and helps me understand the problem more deeply.
              </p>

            <div>
              <h3 class="body-sub-header">Rubber ducky method</h3>
              <p>
                I try to read through the code line by line and understand what each line is doing. This helps me visualise the logic and check which part is wrong. I feel quite confident using this method.

            <div>
              <h3 class="body-sub-header">Reading error messages</h3>
              <p>
                Whenever, I get error messages, I try to read carefully to check which part of code might be causing the issue. I found out that most of time, the error messages auctally provides helpful guidance by pointing me to the exact line or area casuing the problem.

            <div>
              <h3 class="body-sub-header">Console.logging</h3>
              <p>
                Console.log() is extremely useful, especially when working with more complex code. I also find it helpful when using built-in methods that I'm not used to. It helps confirm whether I'm on the right track allows me to test my assumptions quickly.

              <h3 class="body-sub-header">Googling</h3>
              <p>
                I often search things on Google when I get stuck. However, I still find it a bit time-consuming to search for the most relevant or appropriate solution. I think with more practice and experience, I will improve my ability to search efficiently.

              <p>
                I haven't asked peers for help often, but I think it could be useful as peers might have experienced the same problems and could give me the solution that I might not have considered.

            <div>
              <h3 class="body-sub-header">Asking coaches for help</h3>
              <p>
                I sometimes ask coaches for hints or guidance, especially when I've tried multiple problem-solving methods on my own. I usually keep this as my last option for problem-solving.
              </p>

            <div>
              <h3 class="body-sub-header">Improving your process with reflection</h3>
              <p>
                Writing reflections helps me clearly identify the areas I need to improve. Reviewing my previous reflections also reminds me of the lessons I've learnt.
              </p>

            <div>
              <h3 class="body-sub-header">4. Reflect on a time you were reluctant to ask for help. Consider what made you reluctant to do so. What might you try differently next time?</h3>
              <p>
                I'm not afraid of asking for help, but I try not to rely too much on others. Because of that, I sometimes become reluctant to reach out to other, even when I'm stuck. I often feel like I should solve the problem on my own first, which can slow me down when I can't move forward. Next time, I will remind myself that asking for help doesn't mean I'm not capable as it is part of the learning process.
