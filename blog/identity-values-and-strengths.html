            <p>During a university group project, one of our team members was unable to participate fully due to personal reasons. As a result, the rest of us had to deal with much more workload, and the completeness of our project was not meet our expectation.</p>
            <p>We discussed whether to inform our tutors about our situation. Once the tutors know, they might consider our situation and potentially give us a better grade. However, after the discussion, we decided not to inform our tutors because we wanted to support our teammate, who had sincerely apologised and contributed as much as possible despite his personal issue.</p>
            <p>In the result, we still acheived the grad we had aimed for, and our teamamte was grateful for our understanding. He promised to support in the future if we ever needed help. Through this experience, I reminded the value of empathy and consideration for others. At that moment, we valued fairness and human love over the potential benefit for individuals, and I believe it was the right decision.</p>

            <h3 class="body-sub-header">Describe how your culture and the people around you have influenced your values and identity.</h3>
            <p>I have been growing up in both South Korea and New Zealand and my value and identity has been influenced both cultures and the people around me.</p>
            <p>While I was in Korea, I learnt the importance of interact with others with respect and staying fully focused on the task I'm on. This has influenced how I listen and accept opinions of others and learn from them and work efficiently to complete tasks in timely manner.</p>
            <p>Since I moved to New Zealand, I learnt how to express my thoughts and suggest my ideas within a team. Also, I had given a lot of situations where I need to show my creativity and solve the problem from different perspectives.</p>
            <p>Though these experiences, I was able to bulid strong collaboration skills, strong concentration, and creativity.</p>

            <h3 class="body-sub-header">Identify your strengths and how they will support you during your learning journey.</h3>
            <p>I believe my strengths would help me during this learning journey will be interacting with people and critical thinking.</p>
            <p>I don't hesitate to ask people for a help and enjoy supporting others. I'm also confident to find a middle ground when each team members bring up with different ideas.</p>
            <p>Furthermore, I constantly question myself to think outside the box which will lead to the potential improvement and to ensure I fully understand concepts.</p>

            <h3 class="body-sub-header">Evaluate your limitations in terms of your learning and career development. How might these affect your learning journey?</h3>
            <p>I always judge and evaluate myself strictly and critically, which sometimes it make me to lose self-confidence. However, I try to engage and accept feedbacks with a growth mindset.</p>
            <p>By acknowledging my weakness and focusing on inmprovement rather than perfection, I believe this would become my future strength.</p>

            <h3 class="body-sub-header">Share an example of when you were trying to work productively with others, but there was resistance or tension. Discuss strategies you tried at the time, how effective they were, and your reflections on what other strategies you would try now and why.</h3>
            <p>I've experienced situatios where collaboration became harder and more complicated as more people and departments got involved. Each individual and team had their own priorities which making it difficult to find a middle ground.</p>
            <p>We began with focusing on understanding each individual's and department's perspectives and identify their needs. While it is impossible to fully satisfy everyone, we prioritised consideration and compromise which lead us to the best possible solution for the group as a whole.</p>
