            <h3 class="body-sub-header">Research Neuroplasticity</h3>
          </div>

          <div>
            <h3 class="body-sub-header">Discuss how understanding the principles of neuroplasticity benefits people.</h3>
            <p>
              There are 10 principles of neuroplasticity: Use It or Lose It, Use It and Improve It, Specificity, Repetition Matters, Intensity Matters, Time Matters, Salience Matters, Age Matters, Transference or Generalization, Interference. These principles help us understand how the brain adapts to change and learn over time.
            </p>
            <p>
              By applying these principles, neuroplasticity can significantly improve people's well-being. For example, it supports recovery after injuries by helping individuals adapt to new physical or mental conditions. It allows people to relearn skills that were lost due to injury or illness. Also, neuroplasticity helps in learning new skills by allowing the brain create new neural pathways, strengthen exisiting ones, or replacing that are no longer useful.
            </p>

          <div>
            <h3 class="body-sub-header">Discuss how you might engage with the principles of neuroplasticity for your benefit.</h3>
            <p>
              Based on the principles of 'Use It and Improve It' and 'Time Mattters', consistently practicing a skill over time helps enhance that skill. The more I train and repeat certain skills, the more efficiently my brain can bulid and reinforce the pathway related to those skills. This helps me to improve my performance and retain what I've learnt.

          <div>
            <h3 class="body-sub-header">What are some of the ways to increase your neuroplasticity?</h3>
            <p>
              I believe that exposing myself to a lot of different environments and experiences will improve my neuroplasticity. By facing to unfamiliar or challenging environments, my brain will create new neural pathways. This helps me adapt more easily and learn new skills that are necessary for those environments.

              Practicing coding regularly and spending time on problem-solving will especially beneficial for me. It not only enhance my technical skills, but also create a new neural pathways, helping me code more efficiently over time and strengthening my ability to learn and adapt

          <div>
            <h3 class="body-sub-header">Research Growth Mindset</h3>
          </div>

          <div>
            <h3 class="body-sub-header">Discuss what it is and why it is relevant.</h3>
            <p>
              A growth mindset is the belief that abilities and intelligence can be developed through effort, practice, and learning. This is opposite of fixed mindset, which assumes that abilities and intelligence are determined at birth and cannot changed.
            </p>
            <p>
              People with a fixed mindset often see failure as a reflection of their limits and may become discouraged. However, people with a growth mindset see failure as an opportunity to learn and grow. This mindset encourages persistence, and a proactive approach to challenges. It is highly relevant in both personal development and learning.

          <div>
            <h3 class="body-sub-header">In this exploration, did anything surprise you? Change for you?</h3>
            <p>
              During the research about growth mindset, I was surprised to learn that people with fixed mindset often try to exaggeratedly show off their ability and hide their mistake. However, people with growth mindset focus a clear learning goal and don't hesitate to ask questions. They admit what they don't know and try to find out a new approach to solve the problems. This perspective helped me to understand the attitudes that support continuous improvement.

          <div>
            <h3 class="body-sub-header">How will you integrate growth mindset into your learning journey?</h3>
            <p>
              I wanted to change my mindset by removing limitations myself. I've realised that these mental barriers can hold me back from developing a growth mindset. By removing limitations, I will be more open to challenges, more accepting the mistake I make, and focus more on learning rahter than getting right.

              Practicing coding in different scenarios will be helpful for me. I believe that the more effort I put into problem solving problems, the more my skills and efficiency will improve.

          <div>
            <h3 class="body-sub-header">Blend with your learning plan and strategies</h3>
          </div>

          <div>
            <h3 class="body-sub-header">Reflect and discuss how these understandings may shape or influence your learning plan and strategy.</h3>
            <p>
              I believe neuroplasticity and growth mindset are deeply related to each other and both leading to the same goal which are continuously growth and improvement. By removing self-limitations and encouraging myself to keep learning, will allow me to be more open to challenges, accept failure and think it as a learning opportunity.
            </p>
            <p>
              This mindset will push me to keep pracicing and experience a lot of different coding scenarios. Through these effort, my brain can create a new neural pathways, allowing me to develop new skills and enhance the skills I already have.
