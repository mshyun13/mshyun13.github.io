            <div>
              <h3 class="body-sub-header">What are three new things you have learnt about yourself and your ego due to the Human Skills learning?</h3>
              <p>The three new things I have learnt about myself are my identity, my values, and my growth mindset. I hadn't really thought deeply about my identity and values before. Through Human Skills learning, I realised that being born in South Korea and moving to New Zealand has positively shaped who I am today. I also learnt that I need to work on developing a stronger growth mindset such as seeing my failure as an opportunity to improve rather than something negative. I hope this mindset will help me successfully complete this course at Dev Academy.</p>

            <div>
              <h3 class="body-sub-header">What are the role of values, empathy, and self-awareness in learning and programming?</h3>
              <p>I think they are all essential Human Skills that help us support each other and understand ourselves better, allowing us to persist through challenges and finish the course successfully without burning out.</p>
            </div>

            <div>
              <h3 class="body-sub-header">What has surprised you the most about the Human Skills learning?</h3>
              <p>I was surprised by how powerful it is to be listened to and to listen fully to others. It made me feel more empathised with reminded me that I'm not alone. I realised that everyone at Dev Academy is facing similar challenges and it creates a sense of shared experience and support.</p>
            </div>

            <div>
              <h3 class="body-sub-header">What were the most challenging aspects of the Human Skills learning?</h3>
              <p>For me, developing my growth mindset was the most challenging part. It's hard not to give up when facing failure. I'm trying to trust that I can imporve and keep looking forward to the next projects and tasks.</p>
            </div>

            <div>
              <h3 class="body-sub-header">Why do you think we, a programming school, are spending so much time focusing on Human Skills learning in a web development Bootcamp course?</h3>
              <p>I believe Human Skills, like collaboration and self-awareness, are essential for working in the tech industry. Companies don't just hire based on technical skills. They also look for people who can work well with others, handle challenges, and keep learning. Also, since programming can sometimes feel endless and frustrating, strong Human Skills help us stay motivated and resilient.</p>
            </div>

            <div>
              <h3 class="body-sub-header">Does the time you spent studying Human Skills learning here feel like a waste of time? Should you have just used that time to practise programming instead? Justify your answer.</h3>
              <p>I don't think it was a waste of time at all. I believe Human Skills are valuable in the long run and will actually help me become a better programmer. Strong Human Skills can be the trigger that boosts our technical growth, making us more effective and adaptable developers.</p>
