              <h3 class="body-sub-header">An analogy to describe JavaScript and its relationship to HTML and CSS.</h3>
              <p>HTML defines the structure of a web page. It locates elements like texts, images, and links which allowing users to understand the basic framework of the website.</p>
              <p>CSS is responsible for the design and layout of the web page. It controls visual aspects like colours, text fonts, and spacing. CSS provides the consistent style across the website.</p>
              <p>JavaScript handles the behaviour and interactivity of a web page. It enables dynamic features like button clicks, form submissions, animations, and more. JavaScript makes the website more engaging and user friendly.</p>
              <p>Think of it like building a house. HTML is the foundations and frame of a house. It sets up the walls, roof and general layout. CSS is like a interior design. It decides the colour of the wallpaper, arranges the furnitures, and chooses lighting. JavaScript makes the house smart. It installs systems that let you control all the lights with a single switch, or adjusting the temperature automatically with a smart thermostat.</p>
              <p>To put it simply, HTML builds the structure, CSS styles it, and JavaScript brings it to life by adding interactive features.</p>

            <div>
              <h3 class="body-sub-header">Explain control flow and loops using an example process from everyday life.</h3>
              <p>Control flow refers to the flow or order in which code is executed. In programming, control flow is managed mainly through two types of statements, the conditional statments and iterative statements. A common example of a conditional statement is the 'if-else' statment, while an example of an iterative statement is the 'for' loop.</p>
              <p>The 'if-else' statement determines what happens next based on a specific condition. A real life example would be choosing what to cook for dinner. Depending on what ingredients are available, the dinner plan changes. For instance, if I have tomato sauce but no oven, I can't make pizza. However, if I have tomato sauce and spaghetti noodles, I can decide to cook tamato sphaghetti instead.</p>
              <p>The 'for' loop repeats a block of code until a certain condition is met. In a real life example, this is like being a primary school student during the school term. Until the term breaks comes, for about 12 weeks, students follow the same routine each day. They have to attend english class, math class, and science class according to the timetable. This continues daily until the term break arrives. Once the break starts, the routine stops, just like a loop ending when its condition is no longer true.</p>

            <div>
              <h3 class="body-sub-header">Describe what the DOM is and an example of how you might interact with it.</h3>
              <p>DOM stands for Document Object Model. So what is Document Object? When we make HTML tags like 'html' tag, 'body' tag into an object that JavaScript can access, modify, we call it Document object. The Document Object Model in broad meaning, means the way web browser recognise the HTML page. In a narrow meaning, it is a set of object related to doument object.</p>
              <p>For example, you can use JavaScript to change the text or styling of a 'p' tag. Here is a simple example:</p>
            </div>
            <div>
              <div class="div-border body-border">
                <div>
                  <img src="../images/DOM example - p tag.PNG" alt="example of p tag">
                </div>
                <div>
                  <img src="../images/DOM example.PNG" alt="example of DOM">
                </div>
              </div>
            </div><br>

            <div>
              <h3 class="body-sub-header">Explain the difference between accessing data from arrays and objects.</h3>
              <p>Both arrays and objects are used to store collection of data in JavaScript, but they work in different ways.</p>
              <p>Arrays store data in specific order using numbered indexes. They are useful when the order of data matters, and you access items by their position, like 'array[0]'.</p>
              <p>Objects store data as key-value pairs, where each vallue is labeled with a key. They don't guarantee order and are great when you want to access data by name, like 'object["name"]' or 'object.name'</p>
              <p>Here is a simple example:</p>
            </div>
            <div>
              <div class="div-border body-border">
                <div>
                  <img src="../images/array example.PNG" alt="example of array">
                </div>
                <div>
                  <img src="../images/object example.PNG" alt="example of object">
                </div>
              </div>
            </div><br>

            <div>
              <h3 class="body-sub-header">Explain what functions are and why they are helpful.</h3>
              <p>JavaScript function is a block of code designed to perform specific task. The function can be called muliple times, and will execute the same code each time. Functions can also take parameters to produce different outcome depending on what parameters were passed in.</p>
              <p>Functions are helpful as they make the code more reusable, organised, and eaiser to maintain. Instead of writing the same logic over and over, a function can be defined once and can be reused whenever needed.</p>
