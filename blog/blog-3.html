          When I'm away from you
          I'm happier than ever
          Wish I could explain it better
          I wish it wasn't true
          Give me a day or two
          To think of something clever
          To write myself a letter
          To tell me what to do, mm-mm
          Do you read my interviews?
          Or do you skip my avenue? (My avenue)
          When you (when you) said you were passing through
          Was I even on your way?
          I knew when I asked you to (when I asked you to)
          Be cool about what I was telling you
          You'd do the opposite of what you said you'd do (what you said you'd do)
          And I'd end up more afraid
          Don't say it isn't fair
          You clearly weren't aware that you made me miserable
          So if you really wanna know
          When I'm away from you (when I'm away from you)
          I'm happier than ever (happier than ever)
          Wish I could explain it better (wish I could explain it better)
          I wish it wasn't true (wish it wasn't true), mm-hm
          You call me again, drunk in your Benz
          Driving home under the influence
          You scared me to death, but I'm wasting my breath
          'Cause you only listen to your fucking friends
          I don't relate to you
          I don't relate to you, no
          'Cause I'd never treat me this shitty
          You made me hate this city
          And I don't talk shit about you on the internet
          Never told anyone anything bad
          'Cause that shit's embarrassing, you were my everything
          And all that you did was make me fucking sad
          So don't waste the time I don't have
          And don't try to make me feel bad
          I could talk about every time that you showed up on time
          But I'd have an empty line 'cause you never did
          Never paid any mind to my mother or friends
          So I shut 'em all out for you 'cause I was a kid
          You ruined everything good
          Always said you were misunderstood
          Made all my moments your own
          Just fucking leave me alone, whoa, yeah

          I want you to stay
          'Til I'm in the grave
          'Til I rot away, dead and buried
          'Til I'm in the casket you carry
          If you go, I'm going too, uh
          'Cause it was always you, alright
          And if I'm turnin' blue, please don't save me
          Nothing left to lose without my baby
          Birds of a feather, we should stick together, I know
          I said I'd never think I wasn't better alone
          Can't change the weather, might not be forever
          But if it's forever, it's even better
          And I don't know what I'm cryin' for
          I don't think I could love you more
          It might not be long, but baby, I
          I'll love you 'til the day that I die
          'Til the day that I die
          'Til the light leaves my eyes
          'Til the day that I die
          I want you to see, hm
          How you look to me, hm
          You wouldn't believe if I told ya
          You would keep the compliments I throw ya
          But you're so full of shit, uh
          Tell me it's a bit, no
          Say you don't see it, your mind's polluted
          Say you wanna quit, don't be stupid
          And I don't know what I'm cryin' for
          I don't think I could love you more
          Might not be long, but baby, I
          Don't wanna say goodbye
          Birds of a feather, we should stick together, I know ('til the day that I die)
          I said I'd never think I wasn't better alone ('til the light leaves my eyes)
          Can't change the weather, might not be forever ('til the day I die)
          But if it's forever, it's even better
          I knew you in another life
          You had that same look in your eyes
          I love you, don't act so surprised
